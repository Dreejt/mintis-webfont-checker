# Webfont Checker

## Overview
Webfont Checker is a powerful tool designed to analyze the fonts used on a WordPress website. It scans all internal pages, detects which fonts and font-weights are actively used, and identifies unnecessary fonts loaded via `@font-face` or preload links.

This tool is particularly useful for optimizing performance by removing unused webfonts, reducing page load times, and improving overall efficiency.

## Features
- **Automatic site crawling**: Scans all internal pages to ensure complete font analysis.
- **Font weight detection**: Identifies all font-weights used across the website.
- **Preload & @font-face analysis**: Detects fonts loaded via `@font-face` rules and preload links.
- **Identifies unused fonts**: Helps optimize performance by suggesting font removals.
- **Supports WordPress WP-CLI**: Easily integrate with WordPress via WP-CLI commands.

## Requirements
- **Node.js** (must be installed and available in the system path)
- **Puppeteer** (automatically installed if missing)
- **WP-CLI** (WordPress Command Line Interface)

## Installation
### 1. Install via Composer 
`composer require mintis/webfont-checker --dev`

### 2. Activate WP-CLI Command
After installation, WP-CLI should automatically register the `webfont` command.
To verify installation, run:
`wp webfont scan`

If the command is not found, ensure WP-CLI is properly installed and that the package is correctly registered.

## Usage
### Running a Font Scan
To perform a full scan of your website, use the following command:
`wp webfont scan`

### Example Output
